{"name":"gs","body":"# Make your life easier with gemsets\r\n\r\nWe have all become familiar with the concept of gemsets. They come in different shapes and sizes, and provide isolation for project dependencies. Some of the libraries that implement gemsets are [rip](https://github.com/defunkt/rip), [RVM](https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/gemsets/) and [rbenv-gemset](https://github.com/jamis/rbenv-gemset).\r\n\r\nThis library recreates the absolutely minimal feature set for creating and using gemsets.\r\n\r\n## Introductory screencast\r\n\r\nIf you want to see this workflow in action, [check the introductory video](http://vimeo.com/soveran/gs). The other tool showcased in the screencast is [dep](http://twpil.github.com/dep/), a dependency tracker.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThis library provides a command line application called `gs`. These are the available options:\r\n\r\n### gs init\r\nCreates the $PWD/.gs directory.\r\n\r\n### gs help\r\nDisplays the documentation.\r\n\r\n### gs [command]\r\n\r\nWhen called with no arguments, it starts a shell session and\r\nconfigures the variables GEM_HOME, GEM_PATH and PATH to point to the\r\n$PWD/.gs directory. In addition, it sets the GS_NAME variable with the\r\nname of the current gemset (useful for PS1).\r\n\r\nWhen called with arguments other than init or help, it will execute\r\ncommand in a gs shell session and return to the parent session once\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nFirst, grab the gem:\r\n\r\n      $ gem install gs\r\n\r\nNext, type `gs init` within your project and then just `gs` to start the subshell. The environment variables used by RubyGems will now point to the `.gs` directory, and every gem you install, every gem you remove, will use that path.\r\n","tagline":"Gemset management","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
